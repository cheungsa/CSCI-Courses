# Search Engine

This is a simple web search engine made from scratch. It is based on the following components:
1. A crawler, which tries to retrieve all the pages from the web.
2. A program that parses the Markdown-formatted web pages to extract the relevant information, such as text, links, etc.
3. A program that has access to a local copy of all stored and parsed pages, and provides quick lookup of all the pages that contain the words of the query.
4. A PageRank algorithm that takes all results and puts them in an order of relevance to the given query.
